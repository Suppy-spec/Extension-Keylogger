# Extension-Keylogger
A modified version of my original code, except instead of being a bookmarklet, it functions as a Extension!
**This is a keylogger, do not put this on other peoples computers.**
I assume you already know how to put this together correctly, so I'll skip that.
Note, this is not built to persist over webpage refreshes, nor send the keys anywhere. If you wish for it to persist over web refreshes, either contact me or use my bookmarklet version. I would like to say there are no backdoors in this, nor anything malicious apart from the theory of what you could do with this. Have fun!

**Note: This is my second github project! Please like it if you enjoyed it!**
This may also be a bit clunky sometimes, I'm still learning alright?
